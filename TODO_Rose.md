# TO DO LIST

[ ] execution_each_branch();
[ ] build in funtions
[ ] How to handle || && when execute
[ ] Handle parenthesis ()

# Step
1. split branch cmd / redirect / pipe
2. token



# Note
- branch should contain infile / outfile of each cmd (io can have more than 1)
- Make a list that give the rank for execution (rank1 && rank2) && rank3
- Shell always executes inside the parentheses first â€” because parentheses () mean subshell, and subshell runs first to produce a result.
- (..) mean subshell -> child process
